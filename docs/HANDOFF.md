# Handoff

**Living document. Read this first if you are a fresh session.** It is the only file that
says what is *currently true*; everything else says what is *always true*.

Updated at every phase boundary, so that if a session ends — for any reason — the next one
picks up cold without archaeology.

**Last updated:** autonomous build-out has begun; owner has delegated build authority
and an hourly heartbeat is being set up. **First code exists and is verified**: the
dialogue engine (core), the first written scene, the Phase-1 texture set, and the check
gate. The NeoForge toolchain itself is **blocked on the environment's network policy** —
see "Waiting on owner", item 1.

## Where things stand

**There is no Minecraft mod yet.** There is a **toolchain, a palette system, and a doc set**,
all of which are deliberately subject-agnostic and survive whatever the mod turns out to be.

| | State |
|---|---|
| Gradle project | **not created** |
| Java source | **none** |
| Textures / models / data | **none** |
| Palette system | **working and verified** |
| Texture pipeline | **working and verified** (paint kit + review bench) |
| Doc set | **complete** — 13 documents, see [`INDEX.md`](INDEX.md) |

### The god can die

`Deicide.commit()` is the one place the catastrophe happens, and it is idempotent -- a
world can lose its god exactly once. Its consequence today: **the sun stops.** The day
cycle was the god's, and with nobody left to turn it the light stays where it was. Per
`WORLD.md` there is no announcement and no name; the world simply stops moving.

Two callers, one implementation: the pickup handler (needs a real player) and
`/interregnum record deicide` (does not). That is deliberate -- it is what lets the
untestable path be three lines of adapter over a path that is verified end to end.

`tools/deicide_check.sh` asserts the whole beat and was mutation-verified: removing the
consequence and removing idempotence both fail it by name.

### Chapter state persists

`/interregnum status` reports the world's chapter; `/interregnum record <milestone>` (level
2) advances it. State lives on the overworld's saved-data storage -- the interregnum is a
fact about the world, not about a place in it -- and serialises through the same single
string `ChapterState` already round-trips in the core self-test.

`tools/persistence_check.sh` proves it across five server boots, including a mutation of
**already-loaded** saved data, which is the only path where `setDirty()` matters
(LESSONS #13). It has a fresh-world control, without which the other runs prove nothing.

### Worldgen works

Shrines generate. `ShrineFeature` builds a 5x5 court with a carved centre stone, corner
steles, and missing paving for age; it refuses uneven ground rather than terracing it, and
it scans for the surface rather than reading a worldgen heightmap so it can also be run with
`/place` (LESSONS #11). Configured feature, placed feature and the biome modifier are all
**generated** by `runServerData`; the modifier targets the `#minecraft:is_overworld` **tag**,
never a biome list.

`tools/worldgen_check.sh` places a shrine in a live flat world and asserts what it built.
Verified failing two ways -- a wrong assertion, and a deliberately broken feature.

`tools/shrine_rate_probe.sh` measures density on **real** terrain (`GRID=8` takes ~2 min).
Measured: **45-46% of natural sites are level enough**, so with the rarity filter at 55 the
real density is **one shrine per ~120 chunks, roughly six minutes of walking**. Re-run it
after any change to `MAX_RELIEF` or the rarity filter -- they multiply. Whether six minutes
reads as furniture or as litter is **[NEEDS PLAYTEST]**; only a person can say.

### Verifying against a live server

`tools/server_smoke.sh` boots a dedicated server, and `COMMANDS` (newline-separated) runs
them over **RCON**, printing the server's own replies:

```sh
COMMANDS='forceload add 0 0 15 15
setblock 8 66 8 interregnum:warning_stele[axis=y]' ./tools/server_smoke.sh
```

This is the only way worldgen and block behaviour get verified without a client, and it is
how the next tasks (shrine structure, deicide event) will be checked. Note that **stdin does
not reach the server under Gradle's runServer** — RCON is not a preference, it is the only
channel that works. See LESSONS #10.

### Datagen works

`gradle runServerData` regenerates every JSON this mod ships into `src/generated/resources`
(committed, and separate from hand-authored resources so a diff shows at a glance which is
which). The run type is **`serverData`**, not `data`, and `--mod <id>` is **required** —
without it the gatherer logs `Initializing Data Gatherer for mods []` and dies with an
unrelated-looking `RejectedExecutionException`.

**Owner's creative call, delegated and taken:** carved shrine stone drops *plain* shrine
stone. You may take the stone; you may never take the word. It is unannounced, it teaches
that the god-script is not a material before any lore exists, and it makes carved stone
found-only — which turns "learning to inscribe" into a real Theoclast reward later.

### The toolchain works

`gradle build` produces `build/libs/interregnum-0.1.0.jar` against real NeoForge 26.2.0.67,
and `tools/server_smoke.sh` boots a dedicated server, waits for load, shuts it down
cleanly through stdin, and fails if the mod logged anything or if content did not load.

Registered so far: `shrine_stone`, `shrine_stone_carved`, `god_heart`, `clast`, a creative
tab, and the datapack-driven dialogue loader. The loader is the seam between `core/` and
the game: Codecs live in the game module so `core` stays dependency-free.

**Every `VERIFY:` marker in PLATFORM.md is now cleared** — see the verified-values table
there. Markers elsewhere (MODELS.md's item-model system, DATAGEN.md's provider names,
WORLDGEN.md's schemas) are still open and should be cleared the same way: read the sources
in `~/.gradle/caches/.../neoforge-26.2.0.67-sources.jar`, never remember.

### CI

`.github/workflows/checks.yml` runs `tools/check_all.sh` on every push and PR. The
workflow deliberately calls that one script rather than re-listing the checks, so CI and a
local run cannot disagree. No Minecraft toolchain is needed for it yet — everything checked
so far is dependency-free Python and Java 21. Verified by breaking three things in a clean
checkout (stale generated texture, missing translation key, broken doc link); each failed
the gate, and the restored tree passed.

### What actually runs today

```sh
python3 tools/palette_build.py                   # solve ramps -> assets/palette.json
python3 tools/palette_check.py                   # enforce the palette law (exit != 0 on fail)
python3 tools/demo_structure.py docs/img         # the worked example
python3 tools/texview.py <png> --tile 8 --scale 6 # the review bench
```

No dependencies. No pip install. Python 3 only.

- **10 palette families, 34 steps**, tightest separation **0.159 L\*** against a 0.12 floor.
- **All five palette checks verified by reintroducing the bug they catch** — see
  [`VERIFICATION.md`](VERIFICATION.md).
- **`pngio.py` round-trips byte-identically** and decodes real externally-produced PNGs
  (checked against DOWNTIME's Blender exports).

## Decisions on record

| Decision | Value | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Minecraft version | **26.2** ("Chaos Cubed", June 2026) | [`PLATFORM.md`](PLATFORM.md) |
| Loader | **NeoForge** | [`PLATFORM.md`](PLATFORM.md) |
| Java | **21** | [`PLATFORM.md`](PLATFORM.md) |
| Build | Gradle + **ModDevGradle** 2.0.x | [`PLATFORM.md`](PLATFORM.md) |
| Texture resolution | **16×16, no exceptions for blocks/items** | [`ARTSTYLE.md`](ARTSTYLE.md) |
| Art produced by | **generator scripts, not an image editor** | [`TEXTURING.md`](TEXTURING.md) |
| Colour | **`assets/palette.json` or it is a bug** | [`PALETTE.md`](PALETTE.md) |
| Resources | **generated by datagen, not hand-typed** | [`DATAGEN.md`](DATAGEN.md) |

The owner delegated version and loader explicitly: *"Ill use whatever version you think is
best, same with mod loader."* Both are recorded with reasoning so a future session can
overturn them on grounds rather than taste.

## The heartbeat

An hourly Routine (`INTERREGNUM heartbeat`, `trig_01KE2aMo3eAqVz72AtPoJZNW`) fires into
this same session, so it keeps full context. Its prompt is the agreed working contract:
one focused increment per tick, single repo, single branch, never force-push, new scope is
the owner's call, `tools/check_all.sh` green before every commit, and a two-tick circuit
breaker — if all work is blocked or the same failure repeats twice, it stops and says so
rather than improvising.

**Known limitation:** the Routine carries no MCP connectors, so heartbeat ticks have **no
GitHub API tools**. Git over HTTPS still works, so commit and push are fine and PR #1
updates automatically with each push. A tick **cannot** open a new PR, post a comment, or
read PR reviews — if a tick needs any of those, it should record the need in this file and
the owner (or an interactive session) does it.

To pause it: ask, or disable the Routine from the claude.ai Routines UI.

## Waiting on owner

1. **Network allowlist — BLOCKS THE ACTUAL MOD BUILD.** The egress proxy denies the
   NeoForge/Mojang toolchain: `curl` reports `CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403` and the
   proxy logs `connect_rejected ... policy denial` per host. Needed:
   `maven.neoforged.net`, `libraries.minecraft.net`, `piston-meta.mojang.com`,
   `piston-data.mojang.com`, `resources.download.minecraft.net`, `maven.parchmentmc.org`.
   (`services.gradle.org` and Maven Central already pass.)

   **The owner reports having allowed these; this container still denies them.** Network
   policy is applied at container start, so an already-running session keeps the old
   policy. **Re-probe at the start of each new session** with:
   `curl -sS -m 20 -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://maven.neoforged.net/releases/net/neoforged/neoforge/maven-metadata.xml`
   — `200` means unblocked; go straight to task "NeoForge game module". Do not ask the
   owner to change the setting again unless a fresh session still fails.
2. **Playtesting.** This container has no game client. When Phase 1 compiles, the owner
   is the playtester; the handoff will say exactly what to look at.

**Answered:** license is **MIT** (`LICENSE`, `gradle.properties`). `main` branch exists;
work flows to `claude/minecraft-mod-dev-rp0x8j` and PRs into `main`.

## Open questions

### Answered this session

- **The class name**: **Theoclast** — owner's coinage, locked. Breaker and fragment in
  one word; the pieces themselves are **clasts**. Four-voices naming table in `WORLD.md`.
- **The subject**: INTERREGNUM. You accidentally kill the overworld's god by looting a
  shrine chest; vanilla's rules were its policy; the world unravels chapter by chapter
  while you carry the dead god's unanswered letters to its estranged family, looking for a
  successor. Full design + seven-question audit in [`WORLD.md`](WORLD.md).
- **`mod_id`**: `interregnum`, locked, recorded in `PLATFORM.md`.
- **Loader check-in**: NeoForge stands. The mod is broad content+systems (dimensions,
  dialogue, classes, enforcement AI) — the Fabric fork in `PLATFORM.md` was for a small
  mechanical mod, which this is not.

### Still open — [WORKSHOP] with the owner

1. **God roster** — working set is four named gods + the dead one; final count and names.
2. **The dead god's last letter** (the ending document) — co-write with owner, later.

### [NEEDS PLAYTEST] (cannot be settled by argument)

Deicide trigger reliability · clast scarcity · unraveling band pacing.

## Working agreement

Inherited from DOWNTIME, where the owner said: *"this whole project is yours partner, ask me
if you need help with stuff but if not, go ahead and make whatever."* The instruction here
was the same in spirit — *"You know this stuff better than i do"* — so:

- **Decide, document the reasoning, and proceed.** Do not stall on questions that have a
  defensible default; do stall on #1 above, which has none.
- **Push back.** The most valuable thing in DOWNTIME's record is the owner rejecting a
  character that passed every check. That judgement is the best instrument in the project.
- **Never fabricate a lesson.** [`LESSONS.md`](LESSONS.md) holds only things that actually
  happened here; inherited ones are marked PORTED in the doctrine docs. A fabricated war
  story spends the credibility that makes the real ones worth reading.

## What to do next

Done this pass: core dialogue engine (+15 verified checks), first scene + validator,
client-leak guard, `tools/check_all.sh` gate, Phase-1 draft textures (shrine stone,
carved, heart, clast) + block models/blockstates, Gradle scaffold for `core`.

In order, all unblocked unless marked:

1. **Put the heart in the shrine.** The deicide itself is done and tested -- what is
   missing is the way a player *reaches* it. Intent: the heart is present in shrine loot
   only while the god lives, so after DEICIDE no shrine holds one and exactly one heart
   exists per world without ever choosing a shrine in advance. Needs a container (or a
   breakable centre stone) in `ShrineFeature` plus a loot condition on chapter state.
2. **More consequences.** The sun stopping is the first band. Still to come: the crater at
   the site (`Deicide.markSite` is a stub), Warden statues waking, and the unraveling bands
   already defined in data being applied.
3. **The heart in loot**, and the deicide event: sky change, crater, statues wake. The
   core `ChapterState` exists and is tested; it needs a `SavedData` wrapper (codec-based
   in 26.2 — see `SavedDataType`) and the event that records `Milestone.DEICIDE`.
4. **Warden statue → entity.** The biggest single art+code item in Phase 1.
5. **More dialogue scenes** (shrine-keeper, first dream-audience) and the client screen.
   The engine, the loader and the first scene are done and verified end to end.
6. **Clear remaining `VERIFY:` markers** in MODELS.md, DATAGEN.md, WORLDGEN.md against the
   sources jar, exactly as PLATFORM.md's were.

## Standing warning

> **Every API specific in this doc set is marked `VERIFY:` and unverified.**

The docs were written in a sandbox whose egress proxy blocks `neoforged.net` and
`docs.neoforged.net`. Concepts, structure and formats are sound; **exact identifiers are
not** and must be read from the NeoForge sources:

```sh
find ~/.gradle/caches -name 'neoforge-*-sources.jar' 2>/dev/null
```

Modding APIs churn harder than almost anything else in software. A tutorial dated before
2026 is describing a different versioning era *and* a different registration API.
